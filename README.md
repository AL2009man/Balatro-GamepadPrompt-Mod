# Balatro-GamepadPrompt-Mod

test

# Installation

### Pre-requisite:

I highly suggest copying the Balatro.exe file as a backup in case it doesn't work. Also, if a game update comes out, **the modded prompts will be overridden**. if you wanna apply the same mod again: you'll have to go redo the entire step.


## Method 1: Direct Patch
Due to copyright-related issues, I won't be able to provide you with the .exe file, as it contains the entire source code. Thus, I will teach you how to apply the customized button prompts.

1. download any File Archivers programs (ideally: [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [NanaZip](https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip))
2. Open `Balatro.exe` as a Archive/Open inside.
3. Hover straight into `resources` > `textures`
4. Now go back to your Downloaded button prompt folder, pick one of the Button Prompt folders, and drag-and-drop both `1x` and `2x` files inorder to override them, or manually override `gamepad_ui.png` file for both `1x` and `2x` files

# UnInstallation

Two options:

1. delete Balatro.exe completely and Verify game integrity (on your storefront's properties)
2. take your existing Balatro.exe backup and drag it over to the game directory.
